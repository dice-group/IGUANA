INSTALLATION
------------

1. 	To install the benchmark download the latest version [here](https://github.com/AKSW/IGUANA/tree/master).
	The file you need is called iguana-x.y.z-distribution.zip. 

2.	Extract the file in a folder you wish.

3.	If you want to use the Data generation part of the benchmark with the specific type "coherence" you'll need lp_solve 5.5.2.0.
	You can download it here : http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/ otherwise skip to 5.

	The files you need are platform specfic 
	(replace "platform" with your platform. 
	Be aware that you can have a x64 processor but your JVM is a 32-bit installation. If this is the case you need the 32-bit files):
		
		+ lp_solve_5.5.2.0_exe_"platform" .zip or .tar.gz
		+ lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_"platform" .zip or .tar.gz

4.	Extract the libraries (or if you're lazy all the files) into a new folder called lpsolve_lib in your folder with the lib folder

5.	configure your config.xml file as you wish (see the MANUAL for more information)

6.	Start the benchmark with the following line: 

		WITHOUT coherence data generation:

			java -cp "lib/*" org.aksw.iguana.benchmark.Main config.xml (debug=true)?
	
		WITH coherence	data generation (assuming your path of the lp_solve libraries is lpsolve_lib):
			 	
			java -Djava.library.path=lpsolve_lib -cp "lib/*" org.aksw.iguana.benchmark.Main config.xml (debug=true)?

		You can also use the start.bat or start.sh file 
			
			start.bat config.xml 
			start.bat config.xml -Djava.library.path=lpsolve_lib
			start.bat conifg.xml debug=true
			start.bat config.xml -Djava.library.path=lpsolve_lib debug=true
