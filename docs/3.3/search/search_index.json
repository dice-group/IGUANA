It can stresstest HTTP get and post endpoints as well as CLI applications using a bunch of simulated users which will bombard the endpoint using queries. Queries can be anything. SPARQL, SQL, Text and anything else you can fit in one line. What can be benchmarked Iguana is capable of benchmarking and stresstesting the following applications HTTP GET and POST endpoint (e.g. Triple Stores, REST Services, Question Answering endpoints) CLI Applications which either exit after every query or awaiting input after each query What Benchmarks are possible Every simulated User (named Worker in the following) gets a set of queries. These queries have to be saved in one file, whereas each query is one line. Hence everything you can fit in one line (e.g a SPARQL query, a text question, an RDF document) can be used as a query and a set of these queries represent the benchmark.

So ideally you do not need to code anything and can use Iguana out of the box. Iguana will parse your Configuration (YAML or JSON format) and will read which Endpoints/Applications you want to benchmark. What datasets if you have any and what your benchmark should accomplish. Do you just want to check how good your database/triple store performs against the state of the art? Does your new version out performs the old version? Do you want to check read and write performance? ... Whatever you want to do you just need to provide Iguana your tested applications, what to benchmark and which queries to use. Iguana relys mainly on HTTP libraries, the JENA framework and java 11. Overview Iguana will read the configuration, parse it and executes for each specified datasets, each specified connection with the benchmark tasks you specified. After the executions the results will be written as RDF. Either to a NTriple file or directly to a triple store. The results can be queried itself using SPARQL. Iguana currently consists of on implemented Task, the Stresstest. However, this task is very configurable and most definetly will met your needs if you want performance measurement. It starts a user defined amount of Workers, which will try to simulate real users/applications querying your Endpoint/Application. Components Iguana consists of two components, the core controller and the result processor. core controller The core which implements the Tasks and Workers to use. How HTTP responses should be handled. How to analyze the benchmark queries to give a little bit more extra information in the results. result processor The result processor consist of the metrics to apply to the query execution results and how to save the results. Most of the SOtA metrics are implemented in Iguana. If one's missing it is pretty easy to add a metric though. By default it stores its result in a ntriple file. But you may configure it, to write the results directly to a Triple Store. On the processing side, it calculates various metrics. Per run metrics: * Query Mixes Per Hour (QMPH) * Number of Queries Per Hour (NoQPH) * Number of Queries (NoQ) * Average Queries Per Second (AvgQPS) Per query metrics: * Queries Per Second (QPS) * Number of successful and failed queries * result size * queries per second * sum of execution times You can change these in the Iguana Benchmark suite config.

It is divided into 5 categories Connections Datasets Tasks Storages Metrics Additionally a pre and post task script hook can be set. The configuration has to be either in YAML or JSON. Each section will be detailed out and shows configuration examples. At the end the full configuration will be shown. For this we will stick to the YAML format, however the equivalent JSON is also valid and can be parsed by Iguana. Connections Every benchmark suite can execute several connections (e.g. an HTTP endpoint, or a CLI application). A connection has the following items name - the name you want to give the connection, which will be saved in the results. endpoint - the HTTP endpoint or CLI call. updateEndpoint - If your HTTP endpoint is an HTTP Post endpoint set this to the post endpoint. (optional) user - for authentication purposes (optional) password - for authentication purposes (optional) version - setting the version of the tested triplestore, if set resource URI will be ires:name-version (optional) To setup an endpoint as well as an updateEndpoint might be confusing at first, but if you to test read and write performance simultanously and how updates might have an impact on read performance, you can set up both. For more detail on how to setup the CLI call look at Implemented Workers . There are all CLI Workers explained and how to set the endpoint such that the application will be run correctly. Let's look at an example: connections: - name: \"System1\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:8800/query\" version: 1.0-SNAP - name: \"System2\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:8802/query\" updateEndpoint: \"http://localhost:8802/update\" user: \"testuser\" password: \"secret\" Here we have two connections: System1 and System2. System1 is only setup to use an HTTP Get endpoint at http://localhost:8800/query. System2 however uses authentication and has an update endpoint as well, and thus will be correctly test with updates (POSTs) too. Datasets Pretty straight forward. You might want to test your system with different datasets (e.g. databases, triplestores etc.) If you system does not work on different datasets, just add one datasetname like datasets: - name: \"DoesNotMatter\" otherwise you might want to benchmark different datasets. Hence you can setup a Dataset Name, as well as file. The dataset name will be added to the results, whereas both can be used in the task script hooks, to automatize dataset load into your system. Let's look at an example: datasets: - name: \"DatasetName\" file: \"your-data-base.nt\" - name: \"Dataset2\" Tasks A Task is one benchmark Task which will be executed against all connections for all datasets. A Task might be a stresstest which we will be using in this example. Have a look at the full configuration of the Stresstest The configuration of one Task consists of the following: className - The className or Shorthand configuration - The parameters of the task tasks: - className: \"YourTask\" configuration: parameter1: value1 parameter2: \"value2\" Let's look at an example: tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: #timeLimit is in ms timeLimit: 3600000 queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" workers: - threads: 2 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"queries.txt\" timeOut: 180000 - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: noOfQueryMixes: 1 queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" workers: - threads: 2 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"queries.txt\" timeOut: 180000 We configured two Tasks, both Stresstests. The first one will be executed for one hour and uses simple text queries which can be executed right away. Further on it uses 2 simulated SPARQLWorkers with the same configuration. At this point it's recommend to check out the Stresstest Configuration in detail for further configuration. Storages Tells Iguana how to save your results. Currently Iguana supports two solutions NTFileStorage - will save your results into one NTriple File. RDFFileStorage - will save your results into an RDF File (default TURTLE). TriplestoreStorage - Will upload the results into a specified Triplestore This is optional. The default storage is NTFileStorage . NTFileStorage can be setup by just stating to use it like storages: - className: \"NTFileStorage\" However it can be configured to use a different result file name. The default is results_{DD}-{MM}-{YYYY}_{HH}-{mm}.nt . See example below. storages: - className: \"NTFileStorage\" #optional configuration: fileName: \"results-of-my-benchmark.nt\" The RDFFileStorage is similar to the NTFileStorage but will determine the RDF format from the file extension To use RDF/XML f.e. you would end the file on .rdf, for TURTLE end it on .ttl storages: - className: \"NTFileStorage\" #optional configuration: fileName: \"results-of-my-benchmark.rdf\" The TriplestoreStorage can be configured as follows: storages: - className: TriplestoreStorage configuration: endpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/sparql\" updateEndpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/update\" if you triple store uses authentication you can set that up as follows: storages: - className: TriplestoreStorage configuration: endpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/sparql\" updateEndpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/update\" user: \"UserName\" password: \"secret\" For further detail on how to read the results have a look here Metrics Let's Iguana know what Metrics you want to include in the results. Iguana supports the following metrics: Queries Per Second (QPS) Average Queries Per Second (AvgQPS) Query Mixes Per Hour (QMPH) Number of Queries successfully executed (NoQ) Number of Queries per Hour (NoQPH) Each query execution (EachQuery) - experimental For more detail on each of the metrics have a look at Metrics Let's look at an example: metrics: - className: \"QPS\" - className: \"AvgQPS\" - className: \"QMPH\" - className: \"NoQ\" - className: \"NoQPH\" In this case we use all the default metrics which would be included if you do not specify metrics in the configuration at all. However you can also just use a subset of these like the following: metrics: - className: \"NoQ\" - className: \"AvgQPS\" For more detail on how the results will include these metrics have a look at Results . Task script hooks To automatize the whole benchmark workflow, you can setup a script which will be executed before each task, as well as a script which will be executed after each task. To make it easier, the script can get the following values dataset.name - The current dataset name dataset.file - The current dataset file name if there is anyone connection - The current connection name connection.version - The current connection version, if no version is set -> {{connection.version}} taskID - The current taskID You can set each one of them as an argument using brackets like {{connection}} . Thus you can setup scripts which will start your system and load it with the correct dataset file beforehand and stop the system after every task. However these script hooks are completely optional.

Let's assume the taskID is 123/1/1 PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX iprop: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/properties/> PREFIX iont: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/class/> PREFIX ires: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/resource/> SELECT ?noq { ires:123/1/1 iprop:NoQ ?noq } If you want to get all the local worker NoQ metrics do the following: PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX iprop: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/properties/> PREFIX iont: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/class/> PREFIX ires: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/resource/> SELECT ?workerID ?noq { ires:123/1/1 iprop:workerResult ?workerID ?workerID iprop:NoQ ?noq } However if you just want to see the global NoQ metric for all taskIDs in your results do the following: PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX iprop: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/properties/> PREFIX iont: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/class/> PREFIX ires: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/resource/> SELECT ?taskID ?noq { ?suiteID rdf:type iont:Suite . ?suiteID iprop:experiment ?expID . ?expID iprop:task ?taskID . ?taskID iprop:NoQ ?noq. } Instead of the NoQ metric you can do this for all other metrics, except QPS . To retrieve QPS look above in the results schema and let's look at an example. Let's assume the taskID is 123/1/1 again. You can retrieve the global qps values (seen above in ExecutedQueries, e.g QPS , succeeded etc.) as follows, PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX iprop: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/properties/> PREFIX iont: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/class/> PREFIX ires: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/resource/> SELECT ?executedQuery ?qps ?failed ?resultSize { ires:123/1/1 iprop:query ?executedQuery . ?executedQuery iprop:QPS ?qps. ?executedQuery iprop:failed ?failed . ?executedQuery iprop:resultSize ?resultSize . } This will get you the QPS value, the no. of failed queries and the result size of the query.

As in real life endpoints might get multiple simultaneous request within seconds, it is very important to verify that you application can handle this. The stresstest emulates users or applications which will bombard the endpoint using a set of queries for a specific amount of time or a specific amount of queries executed. Each simulated user is called Worker in the following. As you might want to test read and write performance or just want to emulate different user behaviour, the stresstest allows to configure several workers. Every worker configuration can additionaly be started several times, hence if you want one configuration executed multiple times, you can simply tell Iguana to run this worker configuration the specified amount of time. However to assure that the endpoint can't just cache the repsonse of the first request of a query, every worker starts at a pre determined random query, meaning that the single worker will always start at that query to assure fairness in benchmark comparisons, while every worker will start at a different query. Configuration To configure this task you have to first tell Iguana to use the implemented task like the following: tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" Further on you need to configure the Stresstest using the configuration parameter like: tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: timeLimit: 600000 ... As an end restriction you can either use timeLimit which will stop the stresstest after the specified amount in ms or you can set noOfQueryMixes which stops every worker after they executed the amount of queries in the provided query set. Additionaly to either timeLimit or noOfQueryMixes you can set the following parameters queryHandler workers warmup (optional) Query Handling The queryHandler parameter let's the stresstest know what queries will be used. Normally you will need the InstancesQueryHandler which will use plain text queries (could be SQL, SPARQL, a whole RDF document). The only restriction is that each query has to be in one line. You can set the query handler like the following: tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" ... To see which query handlers are supported see Supported Queries Workers (simulated Users) Further on you have to add which workers to use. As described above you can set different worker configurations. Let's look at an example: - className: \"Stresstest\" timeLimit: 600000 workers: - threads: 4 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"/path/to/your/queries.txt\" - threads: 16 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"/other/queries.txt\" fixedLatency: 5000 In this example we have two different worker configurations we want to use. The first want will create 4 SPARQLWorker s using queries at /path/to/your/queries.txt with any latencym thus every query will be executed immediatly after another. The second worker configuration will execute 16 SPARQLWorker s using queries at /other/queries.txt using a fixed waiting time of 5000ms between each query. Hence every worker will execute their queries independently from each other but will wait 5s after each of their query execution before executing the next one. This configuration may simulate that we have a few Users requesting your endpoint locally (e.g. some of your application relying on your database) and several users querying your endpoint from outside the network where we would have network latency and other interferences which we will try to simulate with 5s. A full list of supported workers and their parameters can be found at Supported Workers In this example our Stresstest would create 20 workers, which will simultaenously request the endpoint for 60000ms (10 minutes). Warmup Additionaly to these you can optionally set a warmup, which will aim to let the system be benchmarked under a normal situation (Some times a database is faster when it was already running for a bit) The configuration is similar to the stresstest itself you can set a timeLimit (however not a certain no of query executions), you can set different workers , and a queryHandler to use. If you don't set the queryHandler parameter the warmup will simply use the queryHandler specified in the Stresstest itself. You can set the Warmup as following: tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" warmup: timeLimit: 600000 workers: ... queryHandler: ... That's it. A full example might look like this tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: # 1 hour (time Limit is in ms) timeLimit: 3600000 # warmup is optional warmup: # 10 minutes (is in ms) timeLimit: 600000 # queryHandler could be set too, same as in the stresstest configuration, otherwise the same queryHandler will be use. # workers are set the same way as in the configuration part workers: - threads: 1 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"queries_warmup.txt\" timeOut: 180000 queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" workers: - threads: 16 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"queries_easy.txt\" timeOut: 180000 - threads: 4 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"queries_complex.txt\" fixedLatency: 100 References Supported Queries Supported Workers","title":"Stresstest"},{"location":"usage/stresstest/#stresstest","text":"Iguanas implemented Stresstest benchmark task tries to emulate a real case scenario under which an endpoint or application is under high stress.

We use two small datasets from scholarly data. The ISWC 2010 and the ekaw 2012 rich dataset. mkdir datasets/ cd datasets wget http://www.scholarlydata.org/dumps/conferences/alignments/iswc-2010-complete-alignments.rdf wget http://www.scholarlydata.org/dumps/conferences/alignments/ekaw-2012-complete-alignments.rdf cd .. That's it. Let's setup blazegraph and fuseki. Setting Up Systems To simplify the benchmark workflow we will use the pre and post script hook, in which we will load the current system and after the benchmark stop the system. Blazegraph First let's create the script files cd blazegraph touch load-and-start.sh touch stop.sh The load-and-start.sh script will start blazegraph and use curl to POST our dataset. In our case the datasets are pretty small, hence the loading time is minimal. Otherwise it would be wise to load the dataset beforehand, backup the blazegraph.jnl file and simply exchanging the file in the pre script hook. For now put this into the script load-and-start.sh #starting blazegraph with 4 GB ram cd ../blazegraph && java -Xmx4g -server -jar blazegraph.jar & #load the dataset file in, which will be set as the first script argument curl -X POST H 'Content-Type:application/rdf+xml' --data-binary '@$1' http://localhost:9999/blazegraph/sparql Now edit stop.sh and adding the following: pkill -f blazegraph Be aware that this kills all blazegraph instances, so make sure that no other process which includes the word blazegraph is running. finally get into the correct working directory again cd .. Fuseki Now the same for fuseki: cd fuseki touch load-and-start.sh touch stop.sh The load-and-start.sh script will load the dataset into a TDB directory and start fuseki using the directory. Edit the script load-and-start.sh as follows cd ../fuseki # load the dataset as a tdb directory apache-jena-3.16.0/bin/tdbloader2 --loc DB $1 # start fuseki apache-jena-fuseki-3.16.0/fuseki-server --loc DB /ds & To assure fairness and provide Fuseki with 4GB as well edit apache-jena-fuseki-3.16.0/fuseki-server and go to the last bit exchange the following JVM_ARGS=${JVM_ARGS:--Xmx1200M} to JVM_ARGS=${JVM_ARGS:--Xmx4G} Now edit stop.sh and adding the following: pkill -f fuseki Be aware that this kills all Fuseki instances, so make sure that no other process which includes the word fuseki is running. finally get into the correct working directory again cd .. Benchmark queries We need some queries to benchmark. For now we will just use 3 simple queryies SELECT * {?s ?p ?o} SELECT * {?s ?p ?o} LIMIT 10 SELECT * {?s <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> ?o} save this to queries.txt Creating the Benchmark Configuration Now let's create the Iguana benchmark configuration. Create a file called benchmark-suite.yml touch benchmark-suite.yml Add the following subscections to this file, or simply go to #Full Configuration and add the whole piece to it. Be aware that the configuration will be started on directory level below our working directory and thus paths will use ../ to get the correct path. Datasets We have two datasets, the ekaw 2012 and the iswc 2010 datasets. Let's name them as such and set the file path, s.t. the script hooks can use the file paths. datasets: - name: \"ekaw-2012\" file: \"../datasets/ekaw-2012-complete-alignments.rdf\" - name: \"iswc-2010\" file: \"../datasets/iswc-2010-complete-alignments.rdf\" Connections We have two connections, blazegraph and fuseki with their respective endpoint at them as following: connections: - name: \"blazegraph\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/blazegraph/sparql\" - name: \"fuseki\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:3030/ds/sparql\" Task script hooks To assure that the correct triple store will be loaded with the correct dataset add the following pre script hook ../{{connection}}/load-and-start.sh {{dataset.file}} {{connection}} will be set to the current benchmarked connection name (e.g. fuseki ) and the {{dataset.file}} will be set to the current dataset file path. For example the start script of fuseki is located at fuseki/load-and-start.sh . Further on add the stop.sh script as the post-script hook, assuring that the store will be stopped after each task This will look like this: pre-script-hook: \"../{{connection}}/load-and-start.sh {{dataset.file}}\" post-script-hook: \"../{{connection}}/stop.sh Task configuration We want to stresstest our stores using 10 minutes (60.000 ms)for each dataset connection pair. We are using plain text queries ( InstancesQueryHandler ) and want to have two simulated users querying SPARQL queries. The queries file is located at our working directory at queries.txt . Be aware that we start Iguana one level below, which makes the correct path ../queries.txt To achieve this restrictions add the following to your file tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: timeLimit: 600000 queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" workers: - threads: 2 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"../queries.txt\" Result Storage Let's put the results as an NTriple file and for smootheness of this tutorial let's put it into the file my-first-iguana-results.nt Add the following to do this. storages: - className: \"NTFileStorage\" configuration: fileName: \"my-first-iguana-results.nt\" Full configuration datasets: - name: \"ekaw-2012\" file: \"../datasets/ekaw-2012-complete-alignments.rdf\" - name: \"iswc-2010\" file: \"../datasets/iswc-2010-complete-alignments.rdf\" connections: - name: \"blazegraph\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:9999/blazegraph/sparql\" - name: \"fuseki\" endpoint: \"http://localhost:3030/ds/sparql\" pre-script-hook: \"../{{connection}}/load-and-start.sh {{dataset.file}}\" post-script-hook: \"../{{connection}}/stop.sh tasks: - className: \"Stresstest\" configuration: timeLimit: 600000 queryHandler: className: \"InstancesQueryHandler\" workers: - threads: 2 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" queriesFile: \"../queries.txt\" storages: - className: \"NTFileStorage\" configuration: fileName: \"my-first-iguana-results.nt\" Starting Benchmark Simply use the previous created benchmark-suite.yml and start with cd iguana/ ./start-iguana.sh ../benchmark-suite.yml Now we wait for 40 minutes until the benchmark is finished. Results As previously shown, our results will be shown in my-first-iguana-results.nt . Load this into a triple store of your choice and query for the results you want to use. Just use blazegraph for example: cd blazegraph ../load-and-start.sh ../my-first-iguana-results.nt To query the results go to http://localhost:9999/blazegraph/ . An example: PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> PREFIX iprop: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/properties/> PREFIX iont: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/class/> PREFIX ires: <http://iguana-benchmark.eu/resource/> PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> SELECT ?taskID ?datasetLabel ?connectionLabel ?noq { ?suiteID rdf:type iont:Suite . ?suiteID iprop:experiment ?expID . ?expID iprop:dataset ?dataset . ?dataset rdfs:label ?datasetLabel ?expID iprop:task ?taskID . ?taskID iprop:connection ?connection. ?connection rdfs:label ?connectionLabel . ?taskID iprop:NoQ ?noq. } This will provide a list of all task, naming the dataset, the connection and the no. of queries which were succesfully executed We will however not go into detail on how to read the results.

It tries to emulate a single user/application requesting your system until it should stop. In a task (e.g. the stresstest ) you can configure several worker configurations which will then be used inside the task. Every worker configuration can additionaly be started several times, hence if you want one configuration executed multiple times, you can simply tell Iguana to run this worker configuration the specified amount of time. However to assure that the endpoint can't just cache the repsonse of the first request of a query, every worker starts at a pre determined random query, meaning that the single worker will always start at that query to assure fairness in benchmark comparisons, while every worker will start at a different query. There a few workers implemented, which can be seperated into two main categories Http Workers CLI Workers Http Workers These Workers can be used to benchmark Http Applications (such as a SPARQL endpoint). Http Get Worker A Http worker using GET requests. This worker will use the endpoint of the connection. This worker has several configurations listed in the following table: parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. parameterName yes query the GET paremter to set the query as value to. (see also Supported Queries ) responseType yes The content type the endpoint should return. Setting the Accept: header language yes lang.SPARQL (plain text) The language the queries and response are in (e.g. SPARQL). Basically just creates some more statistics (see Supported Langauges ) timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. Let's look at an example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"HttpGetWorker\" timeOut: 180000 parameterName: \"text\" This will use one HttpGetWOrker using a timeout of 3 minutes and the get parameter text to request the query through. Http Post Worker A Http worker using POST requests. This worker will use the updateEndpoint of the connection. This worker has several configurations listed in the following table: parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. parameterName yes query the GET paremter to set the query as value to. (see also Supported Queries ) contentType yes text/plain The content type of the update queries. Setting the Content-Type: header responseType yes The content type the endpoint should return. Setting the Accept: header language yes lang.SPARQL (plain text) The language the queries and response are in (e.g. SPARQL). Basically just creates some more statistics (see Supported Langauges ) timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. Let's look at an example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"HttpPostWorker\" timeOut: 180000 This will use one HttpGetWOrker using a timeout of 3 minutes. SPARQL Worker Simply a GET worker but the language parameter is set to lang.SPARQL . Otherwise see the Http Get Worker for configuration An Example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"SPARQLWorker\" timeOut: 180000 SPARQL UPDATE Worker Simply a POST worker but specified for SPARQL Updates. Parameters are : parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. timerStrategy yes NONE NONE , FIXED or DISTRIBUTED . see below for explanation. timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. The timerStrategy parameter let's the worker know how to distribute the updates. The fixedLatency and gaussianLatency parameters are not affected, the worker will wait those additionally. NONE: the worker just updates each update query after another FIXED: calculating the distribution by timeLimit / #updates at the start and waiting the amount between each update. Time Limit will be used of the task the worker is executed in. DISTRIBUTED: calculating the time to wait between two updates after each update by timeRemaining / #updatesRemaining . An Example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"UPDATEWorker\" timeOut: 180000 timerStrategy: \"FIXED\" CLI Workers These workers can be used to benchmark a CLI application. CLI Worker This Worker should be used if the CLI application runs a query once and exits afterwards. Something like $ cli-script.sh query HEADER QUERY RESULT 1 QUERY RESULT 2 ... $ Parameters are : parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. An Example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"CLIWorker\" CLI Input Worker This Worker should be used if the CLI application runs and the query will be send using the Input. Something like $ cli-script.sh start Your Input: QUERY HEADER QUERY RESULT 1 QUERY RESULT 2 ... Your Input: Parameters are : parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. initFinished no String which occurs when the application is ready to be requested (e.g. after loading) queryFinished no String which occurs if the query response finished queryError no String which occurs when an error during the query execution happend timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. An Example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"CLIInputWorker\" initFinished: \"loading finished\" queryFinished: \"query execution took:\" queryError: \"Error happend during request\" Multiple CLI Input Worker This Worker should be used if the CLI application runs and the query will be send using the Input and will quit on errors. Something like $ cli-script.sh start Your Input: QUERY HEADER QUERY RESULT 1 QUERY RESULT 2 ... Your Input: ERROR ERROR happend, exiting $ To assure a smooth benchmark, the CLI application will be run multiple times instead of once, and if the application quits, the next running process will be used, while in the background the old process will be restarted.

Parameters are : parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. initFinished no String which occurs when the application is ready to be requested (e.g. after loading) queryFinished no String which occurs if the query response finished queryError no String which occurs when an error during the query execution happend numberOfProcesses yes 5 The number of times the application should be started to assure a smooth benchmark. see above. timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. An Example: ... workers: - threads: 1 className: \"MultipleCLIInputWorker\" initFinished: \"loading finished\" queryFinished: \"query execution took:\" queryError: \"Error happend during request\" CLI Input File Worker Same as the Multiple CLI Input Worker . However the query won't be send to the input but written to a file and the file will be send to the input Something like $ cli-script.sh start Your Input: file-containg-the-query.txt HEADER QUERY RESULT 1 QUERY RESULT 2 ... Parameters are : parameter optional default description queriesFile no File containg the queries this worker should use. initFinished no String which occurs when the application is ready to be requested (e.g. after loading) queryFinished no String which occurs if the query response finished queryError no String which occurs when an error during the query execution happend directory no Directory in which the file including the query should be saved. numberOfProcesses yes 5 The number of times the application should be started to assure a smooth benchmark. see Multiple CLI Input Worker . timeOut yes 180000 (3 minutes) The timeout in MS after a query should be aborted fixedLatency yes 0 If the value (in MS) should be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour. gaussianLatency yes 0 A random value between [0, 2*value] (in MS) will be waited between each query. Simulating network latency or user behaviour.
